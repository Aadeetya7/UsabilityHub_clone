# UsabilityHub_clone
Some logical and more use of css tags.

It is a clone website made using html and css.
In this projects i have made different sections for different sections so that the second person can understand easily.
And Deeply understood the use of Wrap,Flex,hovering,transition,justify content and a new thing learned ,it is small thing but new for which is (!important) tag-which 
means even previously some property is set to an element but by using !important tag we can strictly change it for that particular element.
